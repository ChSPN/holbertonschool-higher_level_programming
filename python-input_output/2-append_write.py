This module contains a function that appends a string at the end of a text file
(UTF8) and returns the number of characters added.

The function append_write takes two arguments, the name of the file and
the text to append. It uses the with statement to ensure the file is properly
closed after it is no longer needed. It creates the file if it doesnâ€™t exist.
No need to manage file permission exceptions.
No module is imported for this function.
